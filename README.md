# Golden Goose Tutoring

Golden Goose Tutoring is an idea for a private tutoring business that my wife is starting in the summer of 2024.
She will be providing 1-to-1 tutoring to Key Stage 2 Children in the local area of Manchester, UK.

As this will be her first time going freelance, she will need an accessible, functional website to entice potential clients to schedule her services. Particular emphasis will be put on creating a clear, attractive layout explaining what to expect from the business, prices and business times.

## Features

* __Navigation & Header__
    * Featured at the top left of the page as the header, the business name - Golden Goose Tutoring - and the links to the other pages displayed to the right.
    * When displayed on mobile & screens smaller than XX, the burger icon to the top right of the screen opens up to display the links to the other pages - Home, Testimonials and Contact - and collapses back when clicked again using a CSS checkbox.
    * On screens larger than XX, links to other pages are displayed the top right hand side of the page to maintain accessibility.
    * The font is a curverd, child-like font colored orange against an off-white background for ease of visual access, and the navigation bar maintain the font & color scheme.

* __Main Home page__
    * The main home page of the site is split into 3 sections. In mobile view the sections are stacked vertically as the user scrolls, and on tablets and larger the main logo and text sits above the about and profile sections. Reactive CSS has been used to see the transformation when condensing and expanding the page for maximum accessibility.
    * __Main text section__
        * The main logo is a simple image with a humerous edge that should engage potential users, and sits in the middle of the page to establish visual flow.
        * Beneath the main logo is the main information and function of the site - what the service is, who could be applicable, area served and price.
        * The text is in the 'Teachers' font in black to provide clean contrast from the background and has a connection to schools and learning.
    * __Profile & Services section__
        * In the profile section, there is a profile-style image of the tutor, with qualifications and employment history summarised in a brief text block.
        * This is an important inclusion as it will establish a quasi-personal connection between the user and the service.
        * The services section, placed below/alongside the profile gives a succint summary in list form  of the benefits of choosing Golden Goose as a tutoring service, with favicons alongside each item to increase visual engagement.
        * Certain key phrases in the services section are shown in __bold__ to draw the users eye to the key information offered by the service.

* __Testimonials page__
    * For a parent to choose a tutoring service, word of mouth is often a very important factor in the decision to use a particular tutor. Therefore having a standalone testimonials page ensures that a whole page is given over to this information, as references are very important in engagement with parents and teachers.
    * There are four testimonials on the page, with the contributors names in bold and favicon quotation marks at the start and end for a little flair, and to punctuate the text blocks.

* __Contact page__
    * As with the main page, the following sections are displayed sequentially on mobiles and side-by-side on devices of XX pixels and larger.
    * __Contact Form section__
        * This form is to collect details from prospective parents, in order to establish a line of communication to the tutor.
        * The inputs collected are first name, last name, email and a small blurb placed in a text box about the child in question.
        * Allowing a textarea element in the form is key as the user/parent will likely need a larger space to enter information about their child, which is more difficult to achieve with more 'formal' elements in a contact form.
    * __Contact details section__
        * Beneath/alongside the form is a list of contact methods and hours, displayed in a list form, and an iframe from google maps displaying the 'catchment area'.
        * This is an important feature for user to be able to contact the business with adhoc requests and gain insight into the location of services offered.
        * The list is punctuated with favicons, and presented in a larger font to provide emphasis.

* __Footer__
    * The footer on all pages are four evenly spaced icons for social media sites; Facebook, Twitter, Discord and Instagram. These links open into new tabs and can be accessed at any time during site navigation to allow for users to explore extra resources relevant to the business.
    * Each icon maintains the header color scheme of a white background with orange icons, which tops and tails the site with a consistent visual theme. 
    * As with the header, the footer is also responsive and the spacing and size of the icons will react to differing device sizes.
