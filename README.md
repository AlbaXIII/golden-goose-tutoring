# Golden Goose Tutoring

Golden Goose Tutoring is an idea for a private tutoring business that my wife is starting in the summer of 2024.
She will be providing 1-to-1 tutoring to Key Stage 2 Children in the local area of Manchester, UK.

As this will be her first time going freelance, she will need an accessible, functional website to entice potential clients to schedule her services.

Particular emphasis is needed to be put on a clear, concise layout displaying her qualifications and experience, as well as testimonial section from current clients.

Throught the website, parents will be able to view a simple explanation of her business and its goals, and will be able to submit an email form from which a line of communication can be established
