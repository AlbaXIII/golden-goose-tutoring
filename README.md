# Golden Goose Tutoring

Golden Goose Tutoring is an idea for a private tutoring business that my wife is starting in the summer of 2024.
She will be providing 1-to-1 tutoring to Key Stage 2 Children in the local area of Manchester, UK.

As this will be her first time going freelance, she will need an accessible, functional website to entice potential clients to schedule her services. Particular emphasis will be put on creating a clear, attractive layout explaining what to expect from the business, prices and business times.
